            <h2>About</h2>
            <div>My name is Brad Schilit. I am a classically trained saxophonist and music educator, turned web developer.</div>
            <p></p>
            <div>I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Engineering Immersion program from Thinkful. Coding became a part of my life from my love of problem solving. I love working to find the little problems in the details of something much larger.
                This applied in my music studies and came right over with me to the world of tech. Outside of programming, I am an active musician, still teaching private lessons and performing chamber music.</div>
